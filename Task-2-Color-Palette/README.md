# Task 2: Color Palette and Redesign

## 📌 What is this task?

In this task, I created a custom color palette and applied it to a UI design using **Figma**.

## 🎨 My Color Palette

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to generate this palette:

| Color Role | HEX Code | Example Use          |
|------------|----------|----------------------|
| Light Aqua | #91F9E5  | Background           |
| Mint Green | #76F7BF  | Buttons / Highlights |
| Fresh Green| #5FDD9D  | Primary Buttons      |
| Teal Green | #499167  | Text / Icons         |
| Dark Green | #2D3E22  | Headers / Footers    |
