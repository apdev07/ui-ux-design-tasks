# Task 2: Color Palette and Redesign

## 📌 What is this task?

In this task, I created a custom color palette and applied it to a UI design using **Figma**.

## 🎨 My Color Palette

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to generate this palette:

| Color Role   | HEX Code | Example Use         |
|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| Light Aqua   | #91F9E5  | Background          |
| Mint Green   | #76F7BF  | Buttons / Highlights|
| Fresh Green  | #5FDD9D  | Primary Buttons     |
| Teal Green   | #499167  | Text / Icons        |
| Dark Green   | #2D3E22  | Headers / Footers   |
